            <dd>
                Dušanov Zlatnik is a Serbian crypto token inspired by the history and legacy of Emperor Dušan.
                It serves as a digital symbol of national pride and as a means to fund cultural and historical projects,
                including the digitization and preservation of Serbian monasteries.
            </dd>

            <dt>2. What is the goal of the project?</dt>
            <dd>
                The goal is to build a community that uses blockchain technology to promote and preserve Serbian
                culture,
                history, and spiritual heritage. In the third phase, special focus will be on creating an NFT collection

            <dd>
                Dušanov Zlatnik is issued on the BNB Smart Chain network (BEP-20 standard), enabling low transaction
                fees
                and fast transfers.

                (10% of total supply) are sold out.
                The end of presale and transition to the next phase will be announced on official channels.
            </dd>

                    </li>

            <dd>
                80% of the raised funds will be used to provide initial liquidity to enable token listing on exchanges
                (Phase 2).<br>
                20% of the funds will be used to provide the first donation in accordance with the project mission.

            <dt>7. Is there a whitelist or entry limitation?</dt>
            <dd>

            </dd>

            <dt>8. What do I get when I buy tokens?</dt>
            <dd>
                You receive ZLATNIK tokens in your wallet, which you can use in future project phases.<br>
                The tokens also serve as a ticket to participate in public auctions for the sale of NFTs of Serbian
                monasteries (Phase 3), as well as potential partner applications.
            </dd>

            <dt>9. What is Phase 3 – NFT Monasteries?</dt>
            <dd>
                Phase 3 involves issuing unique NFTs representing Serbian monasteries with historical descriptions,
                photos, and cultural significance. All proceeds from the public auction sales will be directed towards
                the restoration and protection of cultural heritage.
            </dd>

            <dt>10. Which monasteries will be included in the NFT collection?</dt>
            <dd>
                Among the first will be monasteries from Fruška Gora, precisely 16 of them, some of which are neglected,
                less visited, and in poor condition, as well as many others from Serbia and the wider Serbian spiritual
                heritage.
            </dd>

            <dt>11. How does the project protect against pump and dump schemes, rug pulls, and similar abuses?</dt>
            <dd>
                The Dušanov Zlatnik project has a clear and transparent plan for using funds. The maximum token amount
                per buyer is limited to 1% of the total supply, preventing token concentration in the hands of a few
                individuals. The funds collected in the presale have a precisely defined purpose, and the liquidity
                added to the exchange will be locked for at least 12 months, protecting against rug pull scams and other
                abuses. All activities and transactions are publicly available on BscScan, ensuring full transparency.
            </dd>

            <dt>12. Where can I follow news and updates about the project?</dt>
