    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>What is Dušan's Zlatnik?</strong>
            <p>
                Dušan's Zlatnik is a Serbian crypto token inspired by the history and legacy of Emperor Dušan.

                (10% of the total supply) are sold out. The end of the presale and transition to the next phase

                    <code>0xF173D56F1893aE48A42566EA4f56062e48682F67</code>.

            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Where does the presale money go?</strong>
            <p>
                80% of the collected funds will be used to secure initial liquidity for listing the token on exchanges (Phase 2).<br>
                20% will be allocated for the first donation in line with the project mission.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Is there a whitelist or entry restriction?</strong>
            <p>
                No. The sale is open to everyone who meets the purchase conditions and can technically complete the transaction.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>What do I get when I buy tokens?</strong>
            <p>
                You receive ZLATNIK tokens in your wallet, which can be used in future project phases.<br>
                Tokens also serve as a ticket to participate in public auctions of Serbian monastery NFTs (Phase 3),
                as well as potential partner applications.
            </p>
        </li>

            <strong>What is Phase 3 – NFT Monasteries?</strong>

                Phase 3 involves issuing unique NFTs representing Serbian monasteries with historical descriptions,
                photos, and cultural significance. All proceeds from public auctions will go towards restoration and preservation of cultural heritage.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Which monasteries will be included in the NFT collection?</strong>
            <p>
                The first will include monasteries from Fruška Gora—16 in total—some of which are forgotten,
                less visited, and in poor condition, as well as many others from Serbia and the wider Serbian spiritual heritage.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>How does the project protect against pump-and-dump schemes, rug pulls, and similar abuses?</strong>
            <p>
                Dušan's Zlatnik project has a clear and transparent plan for fund usage. The maximum token amount per buyer is limited to 1% of total supply,
                preventing concentration of tokens in few hands. Funds raised in presale have a precise purpose,
                and liquidity added to exchanges will be locked for at least 12 months,
                protecting against rug pulls and other abuses. All activities and transactions are publicly accessible on BscScan, ensuring full transparency.
            </p>
