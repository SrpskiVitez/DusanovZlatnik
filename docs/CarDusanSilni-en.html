        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Tsar Stefan Dušan Nemanjić, known as Dušan the Mighty, was the most powerful Serbian ruler and one of the
            most significant figures in medieval Southeastern Europe. He was born around 1308, the son of King Stefan
            Dečanski and Queen Teodora. From an early age, he showed exceptional leadership, military talent, and
            strategic thinking. In 1331, after a political conflict with his father, he seized the throne and was
            crowned king in Skopje.</p>

        <h2>Reign</h2>
        <p>During his reign, Dušan launched numerous successful military campaigns, expanding the Serbian state deep
            into Byzantine territory. He conquered Epirus, Thessaly, large parts of Macedonia and Thrace. His empire
            became the largest in medieval Serbian history. He was crowned <strong>Emperor of the Serbs and
                Greeks</strong> on Easter Sunday, April 16, 1346, in Skopje, with the blessing of the Serbian Patriarch,
            the Bulgarian Patriarch, and representatives of Mount Athos.</p>

        <h2>Dušan's Code</h2>
        <p>In 1349, in Skopje, Dušan enacted the first part of his legal code, with a second part added in Serres in
            1354. The <strong>Dušan’s Code</strong> consisted of over 200 articles and regulated civil, ecclesiastical,
            and legal matters. It was one of the most advanced legal systems of its time in Europe. Dušan emphasized
            justice and order, imposing strict punishments for corruption, theft, and treason.</p>

        <h2>Endowments</h2>
        <p>Tsar Dušan was a generous benefactor. His most famous foundation is the <strong>Monastery of the Holy
                Archangels</strong> near Prizren, built near the imperial residence. It combined architectural splendor
            with spiritual significance and served as his burial site. He also supported the restoration and expansion
            of monasteries in Serbia and Greek lands, including on Mount Athos.</p>

        <h2>Hilandar and Orthodoxy</h2>
        <p>Dušan was a staunch protector of Eastern Orthodoxy. He supported monastic life and strengthened the
            independence of the Serbian Church. In 1346, he elevated the Serbian Archbishopric to the
            <strong>Patriarchate of Peć</strong>. He generously donated gold, land, and vineyards to the Hilandar
            Monastery and other religious institutions on Mount Athos.
        </p>

        <h2>Dušan's Gold Coin</h2>
        <p>During his reign, the Serbian state minted high-quality gold and silver coins modeled after Byzantine
            currency. The <strong>Dušan's gold coin</strong> bore his likeness with an imperial crown and a cross in
            hand. It symbolized sovereignty, economic strength, and legitimacy and was widely used in Balkan trade and
            diplomacy.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Tsar Dušan died unexpectedly on December 20, 1355, while preparing for a military campaign toward
            Constantinople. He was buried in the Monastery of the Holy Archangels. He was succeeded by his son Uroš,
            known as Uroš the Weak, who was unable to preserve the unity of the empire. Dušan’s legacy remains a symbol
            of Serbian imperial glory, justice, and spiritual depth.</p>
